The report estimated that sea levels would rise approximately 49 centimeters over the next 100 years, with a range of uncertainty of 20\u201386 centimeters. That will lead to increased coastal flooding through direct inundation and a higher base for storm surges, allowing flooding of larger areas and higher elevations. Climate model simulations predict an increase in average surface air temperature of about 2.5\u00b0C by 2100 (Kattenberg and others 1996) and increase of \u201ckiller\u201d heat waves during the warm season (Karl and others 1997).\n--------\nLongdefinition: Rural land area below 5m is the total rural land area in square kilometers where the elevation is 5 meters or less.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: Center for International Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN - Columbia University, and CUNY Institute for Demographic Research - CIDR - City University of New York. 2021.
