The report estimated that sea levels would rise approximately 49 centimeters over the next 100 years, with a range of uncertainty of 20\u201386 centimeters. That will lead to increased coastal flooding through direct inundation and a higher base for storm surges, allowing flooding of larger areas and higher elevations. Climate model simulations predict an increase in average surface air temperature of about 2.5\u00b0C by 2100 (Kattenberg and others 1996) and increase of \u201ckiller\u201d heat waves during the warm season (Karl and others 1997).\n--------\nLongdefinition: Rural land area in square kilometers, derived from urban extent grids which distinguish urban and rural areas based on a combination of population counts (persons), settlement points, and the presence of Nighttime Lights. Areas are defined as urban where contiguous lighted cells from the Nighttime Lights or approximated urban extents based on buffered settlement points for which the total population is greater than 5,000 persons.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)/Columbia University. 2013.
