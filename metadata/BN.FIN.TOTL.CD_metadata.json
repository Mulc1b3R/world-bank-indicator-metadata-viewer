In BPM6, the headings of the financial account have been changed from credits and debits to net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities; i.e., all changes due to credit and debit entries are recorded on a net basis separately for financial assets and liabilities. Financial account balances are calculated as the change in assets minus the change in liabilities; signs are reversed from previous editions.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Net financial account (BoP, current US$)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLongdefinition: The net financial account shows net acquisition and disposal of financial assets and liabilities. It measures how net lending to or borrowing from nonresidents is financed, and is conceptually equal to the sum of the balances on the current and capital accounts. Data are in current U.S. dollars.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: International Monetary Fund, Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook and data files.\n--------\nTopic: Economic Policy & Debt: Balance of payments: Capital & financial account\n",
