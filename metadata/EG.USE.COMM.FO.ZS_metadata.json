In developing economies growth in energy use is closely related to growth in the modern sectors - industry, motorized transport, and urban areas - but energy use also reflects climatic, geographic, and economic factors (such as the relative price of energy). Energy use has been growing rapidly in low- and middle-income economies, but high-income economies still use almost five times as much energy on a per capita basis.\n\nTotal energy use refers to the use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels (such as electricity and refined petroleum products). It includes energy from combustible renewables and waste - solid biomass and animal products, gas and liquid from biomass, and industrial and municipal waste. Biomass is any plant matter used directly as fuel or converted into fuel, heat, or electricity.\n--------\nGeneralcomments: Restricted use: Please contact the International Energy Agency for third-party use of these data.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total)\n--------\nLicense_Type: Use and distribution of these data are subject to IEA terms and conditions.\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://www.iea.org/terms\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: The IEA makes these estimates in consultation with national statistical offices, oil companies, electric utilities, and national energy experts. The IEA occasionally revises its time series to reflect political changes, and energy statistics undergo continual changes in coverage or methodology as more detailed energy accounts become available. Breaks in series are therefore unavoidable.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Fossil fuel comprises coal, oil, petroleum, and natural gas products.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: IEA Statistics \u00a9 OECD/IEA 2014 (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics), subject to https://www.iea.org/terms/\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Energy data are compiled by the International Energy Agency (IEA). IEA data for economies that are not members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are based on national energy data adjusted to conform to annual questionnaires completed by OECD member governments.\n\nData for combustible renewables and waste are often based on small surveys or other incomplete information and thus give only a broad impression of developments and are not strictly comparable across countries. The IEA reports include country notes that explain some of these differences. All forms of energy - primary energy and primary electricity - are converted into oil equivalents. A notional thermal efficiency of 33 percent is assumed for converting nuclear electricity into oil equivalents and 100 percent efficiency for converting hydroelectric power.\n--------\nTopic: Environment: Energy production & use\n",
