Energy use refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport. PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to 2021 constant international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as a U.S. dollar has in the United States.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: IEA Statistics \u00a9 OECD/IEA 2014 (https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics), subject to https://www.iea.org/terms/\n--------\nTopic: Environment: Energy production & use\n",
