This is leading to an increase in the earth's surface temperature and to related effects on climate, sea level rise and world agriculture. Emissions of CO2 are from burning oil, coal and gas for energy use, burning wood and waste materials, and from industrial processes such as cement production. Emission intensity is the average emission rate of a given pollutant from a given source relative to the intensity of a specific activity. Emission intensities are also used to compare the environmental impact of different fuels or activities. The related terms - emission factor and carbon intensity - are often used interchangeably.\n\nThe carbon dioxide emissions of a country are only an indicator of one greenhouse gas. For a more complete idea of how a country influences climate change, gases such as methane and nitrous oxide should be taken into account. This is particularly important in agricultural economies.\n\nThe environmental effects of carbon dioxide are of significant interest. Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up the largest share of the greenhouse gases contributing to global warming and climate change. Converting all other greenhouse gases (methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)) to carbon dioxide (or CO2) equivalents makes it possible to compare them and to determine their individual and total contributions to global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, an environmental agreement adopted in 1997 by many of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is working towards curbing CO2 emissions globally.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Total greenhouse gas emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)\n--------\nLicense_Type: Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: This series excludes Land-use Change & Forestry (LUCF). \n\nThe world data includes international bunker fuel-related emissions and emissions from territories not part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n--------\nLongdefinition: Total greenhouse gas emissions in kt of CO2 equivalent are composed of CO2 totals excluding short-cycle biomass burning (such as agricultural waste burning and savanna burning) but including other biomass burning (such as forest fires, post-burn decay, peat fires and decay of drained peatlands), all anthropogenic CH4 sources, N2O sources and F-gases (HFCs, PFCs and SF6).\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: Climate Watch Historical GHG Emissions (1990-2020). 2023.
