For Annex-I countries under the UNFCCC, these data are drawn from the annual GHG inventories submitted to the UNFCCC by each country; for non-Annex-I countries, data are drawn from the most recently submitted National Communication where available. Because of differences in reporting years and methodologies, these data are not generally considered comparable across countries. Data are in million metric tons.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n--------\nTopic: Environment: Emissions\n",
