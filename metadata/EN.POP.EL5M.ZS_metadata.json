Most global warming has been caused by human activities that have changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere through a buildup of greenhouse gases - primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Rising global temperatures will cause sea level rise and alter local climate conditions, affecting forests, crop yields, and water supplies, and may affect human health, animals, and many types of ecosystems.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters (% of total population)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) assessment report concluded that global warming is \u201cunequivocal\u201d and gave the strongest warning yet about the role of human activities. The report estimated that sea levels would rise approximately 49 centimeters over the next 100 years, with a range of uncertainty of 20\u201386 centimeters. That will lead to increased coastal flooding through direct inundation and a higher base for storm surges, allowing flooding of larger areas and higher elevations. Climate model simulations predict an increase in average surface air temperature of about 2.5\u00b0C by 2100 (Kattenberg and others 1996) and increase of \u201ckiller\u201d heat waves during the warm season (Karl and others 1997).\n--------\nLongdefinition: Population below 5m is the percentage of the total population living in areas where the elevation is 5 meters or less.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: Center for International Earth Science Information Network - CIESIN - Columbia University, and CUNY Institute for Demographic Research - CIDR - City University of New York. 2021.
