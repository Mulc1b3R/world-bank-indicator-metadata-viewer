A stable financial system that promotes efficient savings and investment is also crucial for a thriving democracy and market economy. There are several aspects of access to financial services: availability, cost, and quality of services. The development and growth of credit markets depend on access to timely, reliable, and accurate data on borrowers' credit experiences. Access to credit can be improved by making it easy to create and enforce collateral agreements and by increasing information about potential borrowers' creditworthiness. Lenders look at a borrower's credit history and collateral. Where credit registries and effective collateral laws are absent - as in many developing countries - banks make fewer loans. Indicators that cover getting credit include the strength of legal rights index and the depth of credit information index.\n--------\nGeneralcomments: Country-specific metadata can be found on the IMF\u2019s FAS website (data.imf.org).\n--------\nIndicatorName: Automated teller machines (ATMs) (per 100,000 adults)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: Population-based ratios of the number of branches and ATMs assume a uniform distribution of bank outlets within a country's area and across its population, while in most countries bank branches and ATMs are concentrated in urban centers of the country and are accessible only to some individuals.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Automated teller machines are computerized telecommunications devices that provide clients of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public place.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: International Monetary Fund, Financial Access Survey.\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Data are shown as the total number of ATMs for every 100,000 adults in the reporting country.
