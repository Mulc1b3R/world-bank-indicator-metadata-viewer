R&D typically involves a few large performers, hence R&D surveys use various techniques to maintain up-to-date registers of known performers, while attempting to identify new or occasional performers. \n\nR&D totals from SNA accounts may differ from these estimates, due in part to the different treatments of software R&D in the totals.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Gross domestic expenditures on research and development (R&D), expressed as a percent of GDP. They include both capital and current expenditures in the four main sectors: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit. R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).

Natural sciences;\n2. Engineering and technology;\n3. Medical and health sciences;\n4. Agricultural sciences;\n5. Social sciences;\n6. Humanities and the arts.\n\nThe data are obtained through statistical surveys which are regularly conducted at national level covering R&D performing entities in the private and public sectors.\n--------\nTopic: Infrastructure: Technology\n",
