It is obtained by recalculating the HCI using estimates of the upper bounds of each of the components of the HCI. The range between the upper and lower bound is the uncertainty interval. While the uncertainty intervals constructed here do not have a rigorous statistical interpretation, a rule of thumb is that if for two countries they overlap substantially, the differences between their HCI values are not likely to be practically meaningful.\n--------\nRelatedindicators: Please visit the Human Capital Index (HCI) database (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/source/human-capital-index) for each of the components of the Human Capital Index as well as for the overall index, disaggregated by gender.\n--------\nSource: World Bank staff calculations based on the methodology described in World Bank (2018). https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/30498\n--------\nTopic: Public Sector: Policy & institutions\n",
