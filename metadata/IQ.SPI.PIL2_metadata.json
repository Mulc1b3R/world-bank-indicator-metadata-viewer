    "metadata": "========\nSeries: IQ.SPI.PIL2\n\nAggregationmethod: Weighted average\n--------\nDevelopmentrelevance: The data services (output) pillar  is segmented by four service types: (i) the quality of data releases, (ii) the richness and openness of online access, (iii) the effectiveness of advisory and analytical services related to statistics, and (iv) the availability and use of data access services such as secure microdata access. Advisory and analytical services might incorporate elements related to data stewardship services including input to national data strategies, advice on data ethics and calling out misuse of data in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Statistical performance indicators (SPI): Pillar 2 data services score (scale 0-100)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: Under the pillar of data services an area that needs improvement is the measurement of advisory and analytical services provided by NSOs, such as data stewardship services. By measuring this type of work done by NSOs that goes beyond producing data, the international community and the NSOs themselves can better assess whether this type of support is in place.\n--------\nLongdefinition: The data services pillar overall score is a composite indicator based on four dimensions of data services: (i) the quality of data releases, (ii) the richness and openness of online access, (iii) the effectiveness of advisory and analytical services related to statistics, and (iv) the availability and use of data access services such as secure microdata access. Advisory and analytical services might incorporate elements related to data stewardship services including input to national data strategies, advice on data ethics and calling out misuse of data in accordance with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics.\n--------\nNotesfromoriginalsource: For pillar 2 on data services, information on data dissemination subscription is collected from the IMF\u2019s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. This and the WDI metadata follow the same update schedule and the release these two sources are identical. The online access indicator is sourced from the Open Data Watch ODIN openness score. The date of the data download is available in the technical description for this indicator. The indicator for data access services is based on (i) whether a portal is available, (ii) compliant with the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and with Dublin Core\u2019s RDF metadata standards, and (iii) which has a listing of surveys and microdata sets that can provide the necessary data and reference for follow-up. This information is collected manually by visiting each NSO website.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nShortdefinition: The data services overall score is a composite score covering dimensions on data releases, online access, advisory and analytical services, and data access services\n--------\nSource: Statistical Performance Indicators, The World Bank (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/statistical-performance-indicators)\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Weighted average of statistical performance indicators related to data services.  Scores range from 0-100 with 100 representing the best score.\n--------\nTopic: Public Sector: Policy & institutions\n",
