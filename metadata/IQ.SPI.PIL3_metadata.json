For each SDG indicator, the database is checked to see whether a value is available within a five year window. (for instance, for 2019 if a value is available between 2015-2019. For OECD countries, the UN SDG database is supplemented with comparable data submitted to the OECD following the methodology in Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets 2019: An Assessment of Where OECD Countries Stand. The decision to supplement the UN Global SDG monitoring database using this OECD database was taken, because a clear methodology had been established to do so. The UN Global SDG monitoring database was chosen as a primary source, rather than individual NSO websites, because data submitted to the UN Global SDG monitoring database goes through a standardized process including quality control and detailed documentation.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nShortdefinition: The data products overall score is a composite score measureing whether the country is able to produce relevant indicators, primarily related to SDGs\n--------\nSource: Statistical Performance Indicators, The World Bank (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/statistical-performance-indicators)\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Weighted average of statistical performance indicators related to data products.
