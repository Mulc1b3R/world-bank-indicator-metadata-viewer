The segments are: (i) legislation and governance covering the existence of laws and a functioning institutional framework for the statistical system; (ii) standards and methods addressing compliance with recognized frameworks and concepts; (iii) skills including level of skills within the statistical system and among users (statistical literacy); (iv) partnerships reflecting the need for the statistical system to be inclusive and coherent; and (v) finance mobilized both domestically and from donors.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Statistical performance indicators (SPI): Pillar 5 data infrastructure score (scale 0-100)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: Finally, several of the \u2018soft\u2019 components of the data infrastructure pillar lack adequate data. This includes the areas of skills and of partnerships between entities in the national statistical system. The dashboard makes use of the PARIS21 led SDG indicator on whether the statistical legislations in countries met the standards of the UN Fundamental Principles of Statistics, but this was not incorporated into the overall SPI score, because of inadequate country coverage. This is also true of the PARIS21 led SDG indicator on whether the national statistical system is fully funded. Countries would need to be encouraged to report on this information.\n--------\nLongdefinition: The data infrastructure  pillar  overall score measures the hard and soft infrastructure segments, itemizing essential cross cutting requirements for an effective statistical system.  The segments are: (i) legislation and governance covering the existence of laws and a functioning institutional framework for the statistical system; (ii) standards and methods addressing compliance with recognized frameworks and concepts; (iii) skills including level of skills within the statistical system and among users (statistical literacy); (iv) partnerships reflecting the need for the statistical system to be inclusive and coherent; and (v) finance mobilized both domestically and from donors.\n--------\nNotesfromoriginalsource: For dimension 5, data on the legislation indicator and finance indicators (compiled by PARIS21) are pulled from the UN SDG global monitoring database. Indicators in the standards and methods pillar are sourced primarily through the IMF. Information on the system of national accounts in use and national accounts base year are sourced through the World Bank\u2019s WDI metadata. Data for the business process indicator is sourced through the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nShortdefinition: The data infrastructure  pillar  overall score measures the hard and soft infrastructure segments, itemizing essential cross cutting requirements for an effective statistical system.\n--------\nSource: Statistical Performance Indicators, The World Bank (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/statistical-performance-indicators)\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Weighted average of statistical performance indicators related to data infrastructure.
