However, because of the wide variability in the effectiveness of public education expenditures, these figures cannot be construed as the value of investments in human capital. A current expenditure of $1 on education does not necessarily yield $1 of human capital. The calculation should also consider private education expenditure, but data are not available for a large number of countries.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Education expenditure refers to the current operating expenditures in education, including wages and salaries and excluding capital investments in buildings and equipment.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: World Bank staff estimates using data from the United Nations Statistics Division's Statistical Yearbook, and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics online database.\n--------\nTopic: Economic Policy & Debt: National accounts: Adjusted savings & income\n",
