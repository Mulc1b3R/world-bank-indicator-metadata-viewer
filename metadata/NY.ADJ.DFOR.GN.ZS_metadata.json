In principle, there should be an addition to savings in countries where growth exceeds harvest, but empirical estimates suggest that most of this net growth is in forested areas that cannot currently be exploited economically. Because the depletion estimates reflect only timber values, they ignore all the external and nontimber benefits associated with standing forests.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Net forest depletion is calculated as the product of unit resource rents and the excess of roundwood harvest over natural growth.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: World Bank staff estimates based on sources and methods in World Bank's \"The Changing Wealth of Nations: Measuring Sustainable Development in the New Millennium\" (2011).\n--------\nTopic: Economic Policy & Debt: National accounts: Adjusted savings & income\n",
