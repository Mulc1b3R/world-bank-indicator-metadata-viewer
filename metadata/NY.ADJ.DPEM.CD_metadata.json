Damages are calculated as foregone labor income due to premature death. Estimates of health impacts from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 are for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013. Data for other years have been extrapolated from trends in mortality rates.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: Data on health impacts from exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution and household air pollution are from the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study. Data are provided by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.\n--------\nTopic: Economic Policy & Debt: National accounts: Adjusted savings & income\n",
