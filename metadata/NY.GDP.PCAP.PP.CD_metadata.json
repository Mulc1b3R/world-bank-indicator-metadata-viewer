Total population is a mid-year population based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: International Comparison Program, World Bank | World Development Indicators database, World Bank | Eurostat-OECD PPP Programme.\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Typically, higher income countries have higher price levels, while lower income countries have lower price levels (Balassa-Samuelson effect). Market exchange rate-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components reflect both differences in economic outputs (volumes) and prices. Given the differences in price levels, the size of higher income countries is inflated, while the size of lower income countries is depressed in the comparison. PPP-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components only reflect differences in economic outputs (volume), as PPPs control for price level differences between the countries. Hence, the comparison reflects the real size of the countries.\n\nFor more information on underlying GDP in current international dollar, please refer to the metadata for \"GDP, PPP (current international $)\" [NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD].\nFor more information on underlying population, please refer to the metadata for \"total population\u201d [SP.POP.TOTL]. \nFor the concept and methodology of PPP, please refer to the International Comparison Program (ICP)\u2019s website (https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp).\n--------\nTopic: Economic Policy & Debt: Purchasing power parity\n",
