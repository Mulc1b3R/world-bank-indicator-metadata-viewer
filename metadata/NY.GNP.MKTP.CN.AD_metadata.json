This series has been linked to produce a consistent time series to counteract breaks in series over time due to changes in base years, source data and methodologies. Thus, it may not be comparable with other national accounts series in the database for historical years.  Data are in local currency, at current prices.\n--------\nSource: World Bank staff estimates based on World Bank national accounts data archives, OECD National Accounts, and the IMF WEO database.\n--------\nTopic: Economic Policy & Debt: National accounts: Local currency at current prices: Expenditure on GDP\n",
