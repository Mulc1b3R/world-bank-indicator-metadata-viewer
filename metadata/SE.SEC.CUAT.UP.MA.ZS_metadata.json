Educational attainment is closely related to the skills and competencies of a country's population, and could be seen as a proxy of both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the stock of human capital.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Educational attainment, at least completed upper secondary, population 25+, male (%) (cumulative)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: Caution is required when using this indicator for cross-country comparison, since the countries do not always classify degrees and qualifications at the same International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) levels, even if they are received at roughly the same age or after a similar number of years of schooling. Also, certain educational programmes and study courses cannot be easily classified according to ISCED. This indicator only measures educational attainment in terms of level of education attained, i.e. years of schooling, and do not necessarily reveal the quality of the education (learning achievement and other impacts).\n--------\nLongdefinition: The percentage of population ages 25 and over that attained or completed upper secondary education.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).

The number 0 means zero or small enough that the number would round to zero. \n\nData are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics mainly from national population census, household survey, and labour force survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011.\n--------\nTopic: Education: Outcomes\n",
