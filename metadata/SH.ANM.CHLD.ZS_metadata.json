Anaemia may result from a number of causes, with the most significant contributor being iron deficiency. Anaemia resulting from iron deficiency adversely affects cognitive and motor development and causes fatigue and low productivity. Children under age 5 and pregnant women have the highest risk for anemia.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Prevalence of anemia among children (% of children ages 6-59 months)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: Data for blood haemoglobin concentrations are still limited, compared to other nutritional indicators such as hild anthropometry. As a result, the estimates may not capture the full variation across countries and regions.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Prevalence of anemia, children ages 6-59 months, is the percentage of children ages 6-59 months whose hemoglobin level is less than 110 grams per liter, adjusted for altitude.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository/World Health Statistics.\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Data on anemia are compiled by the WHO, and a statistical model was used to estimate trends. WHO\u2019s hemoglobin threshold concentration in blood was used.\n--------\nTopic: Health: Nutrition\n",
