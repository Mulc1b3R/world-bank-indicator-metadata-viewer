Prompt and effective treatment of malaria is a critical element of malaria control. It is vital that sufferers, especially children under age 5, start treatment within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, to prevent progression - often rapid - to severe malaria and death. Data on malaria are from national-level surveys, including Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, Demographic and Health Surveys, and Malaria Indicator Surveys.\n--------\nTopic: Health: Disease prevention\n",
