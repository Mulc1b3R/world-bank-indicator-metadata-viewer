WHO's hemoglobin thresholds are then used to determine anemia status based on age, sex, and physiological status.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Prevalence of anemia, pregnant women, is the percentage of pregnant women whose hemoglobin level is less than 110 grams per liter at sea level.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository/World Health Statistics.\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or their oxygen-carrying capacity is insufficient to meet physiologic needs, which vary by age, sex, altitude, smoking status, and pregnancy status.
