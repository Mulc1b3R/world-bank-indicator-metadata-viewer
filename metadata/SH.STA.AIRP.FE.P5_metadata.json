According to the World Health Organization, the combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about 7 million premature deaths every year.  Most deaths occur due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.  The majority of the burden is borne by populations in low and middle income countries.\n--------\nGeneralcomments: This is a sex-disaggregated indicator for Sustainable Development Goal 3.9.1 [https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/].\n--------\nIndicatorName: Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution, age-standardized, female (per 100,000 female population)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: Estimates of the joint effects of air pollution are constrained by limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions\n--------\nLongdefinition: Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution is the number of deaths attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution in a year per 100,000 population. The rates are age-standardized.  Following diseases are taken into account: acute respiratory infections (estimated for all ages); cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years); ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository (http://apps.who.int/ghodata/).\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Burden of disease (or in the present case attributable mortality) is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g.  the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed). This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed  to the exposure (e.g in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter). Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient air pollution). To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).\n--------\nTopic: Health: Mortality\n",
