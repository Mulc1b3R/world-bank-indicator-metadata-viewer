Highest among the elderly, prevalence rates are rising among younger and productive populations in developing countries. Economic development has led to the spread of Western lifestyles and diet to developing countries, resulting in a substantial increase in diabetes. Without effective prevention and control programs, diabetes will likely continue to increase.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Diabetes prevalence (% of population ages 20 to 79)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: The limited availability of data on health status is a major constraint in assessing the health situation in developing countries. Surveillance data are lacking for many major public health concerns. Estimates of prevalence and incidence are available for some diseases but are often unreliable and incomplete. National health authorities differ widely in capacity and willingness to collect or report information.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Diabetes prevalence refers to the percentage of people ages 20-79 who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. It is calculated by adjusting to a standard population age-structure.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: International Diabetes Federation, Diabetes Atlas.\n--------\nTopic: Health: Risk factors\n",
