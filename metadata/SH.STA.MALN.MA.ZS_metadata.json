The group conducts a review when (at minimum) a final report with full methodological details and results are available, as well as (ideally) a data quality assessment flagging potential limitation. When the raw data are available, they are analysed using the Anthro Survey Analyzer software to produce a standard set of results and data quality outputs against which the review is conducted. Comments are documented in a standard review template extracting methodological details (e.g., sampling procedures, description of anthropometrical equipment), data quality outputs (e.g., weight and height distributions, percentage of cases that were flagged as implausible according to the WHO Child Growth Standards) and the malnutrition prevalence estimates from the data source under review generated based on the standard recommended methodology. These estimates are compared against the reported values, as well as against those from other data sources already included in the JME dataset, to assess the plausibility of the trend before including the new point. Reports that are preliminary, or that lack key details on methodology or results, cannot be reviewed and are left pending until full information is available.\n--------\nDerivationmethod: Survey estimates are based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child Growth Standards as described in Recommendations for data collection, analysis and reporting on anthropometric indicators in children under 5 years old and WHO Anthro Survey Analyser.\n--------\nGeneralcomments: Undernourished children have lower resistance to infection and are more likely to die from common childhood ailments such as diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections. Frequent illness saps the nutritional status of those who survive, locking them into a vicious cycle of recurring sickness and faltering growth (UNICEF). Estimates are from national survey data. Being even mildly underweight increases the risk of death and inhibits cognitive development in children. And it perpetuates the problem across generations, as malnourished women are more likely to have low-birth-weight babies. Stunting, or being below median height for age, is often used as a proxy for multifaceted deprivation and as an indicator of long-term changes in malnutrition.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Prevalence of underweight, weight for age, male (% of children under 5)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g., measurement technical error, recording error etc.,). None of the two sources of errors have been fully taken into account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional or worldwide levels.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Prevalence of underweight, male, is the percentage of boys under age 5 whose weight for age is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. The data are based on the WHO's 2006 Child Growth Standards.\n--------\nOtherweblinks: Recommendations for data collection, analysis and reporting on anthropometric indicators in children under 5 years old.
