The ratios cannot be assumed to provide an exact estimate of maternal mortality. Some of the figures shown were adjusted by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG) to enhance reliability, so that they may differ from the published figures from sources such as household surveys.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Maternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: The country data compiled, adjusted and used in the estimation model by the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG). The country data were compiled from the following sources:  civil registration and vital statistics; specialized studies on maternal mortality; population based surveys and censuses; other available data sources including data from surveillance sites.\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Reproductive health is a state of physical and mental well-being in relation to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Means of achieving reproductive health include education and services during pregnancy and childbirth, safe and effective contraception, and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age in developing countries.\n\nMaternal mortality ratios are generally of unknown reliability, as are many other cause-specific mortality indicators. Household surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys attempt to measure maternal mortality by asking respondents about survivorship of sisters. The main disadvantage of this method is that the estimates of maternal mortality that it produces pertain to any time within the past few years before the survey, making them unsuitable for monitoring recent changes or observing the impact of interventions. In addition, measurement of maternal mortality is subject to many types of errors. Even in high-income countries with reliable vital registration systems, misclassification of maternal deaths has been found to lead to serious underestimation.\n\nThe national estimates of maternal mortality ratios are based on national surveys, vital registration records, and surveillance data or are derived from community and hospital records.\n--------\nTopic: Health: Reproductive health\n",
