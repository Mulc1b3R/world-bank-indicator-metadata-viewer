Until the current recommended method for home management of diarrhea is adopted and applied in all countries, the data should be used with caution. Also, the prevalence of diarrhea may vary by season. Since country surveys are administered at different times, data comparability is further affected.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Children with diarrhea who received oral rehydration and continued feeding refer to the percentage of children under age five with diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the survey who received either oral rehydration therapy or increased fluids, with continued feeding.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: UNICEF, State of the World's Children, Childinfo, and Demographic and Health Surveys.\n--------\nTopic: Health: Disease prevention\n",
