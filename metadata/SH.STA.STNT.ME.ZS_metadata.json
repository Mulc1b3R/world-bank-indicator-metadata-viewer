The group conducts a review when (at minimum) a final report with full methodological details and results are available, as well as (ideally) a data quality assessment flagging potential limitations. When the raw data are available, they are analysed using the Anthro Survey Analyzer software to produce a standard set of results and data quality outputs against which the review is conducted. Comments are documented in a standard review template extracting methodological details (e.g., sampling procedures, description of anthropometrical equipment), data quality outputs (e.g., weight and height distributions, percentage of cases that were flagged as implausible according to the WHO Child Growth Standards) and the malnutrition prevalence estimates from the data source under review generated based on the standard recommended methodology. These estimates are compared against the reported values, as well as against those from other data sources already included in the JME dataset, to assess the plausibility of the trend before including the new point. Reports that are preliminary, or that lack key details on methodology or results, cannot be reviewed and are left pending until full information is available. The methods used to generate the JME global estimates for stunting and overweight were cross validated to ensure estimates produced by the method are closely aligned to national data points.\n--------\nDerivationmethod: National estimates from primary sources (e.g., from household surveys) used to generate the JME global estimates are based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child Growth Standards as described in Recommendations for data collection, analysis and reporting on anthropometric indicators in children under 5 years old and WHO Anthro Survey Analyser (WHO, 2019). The JME global estimates are generated using smoothing techniques and covariates applied to quality-assured national data to derive trends and up-to-date estimates. Worldwide and regional estimates are derived as the respective country averages weighted by the countries\u2019 under-five population estimates (UNPD-WPP latest available edition) using annual JME global estimates for 205\nCountries and areas.\n--------\nGeneralcomments: Undernourished children have lower resistance to infection and are more likely to die from common childhood ailments such as diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections. Frequent illness saps the nutritional status of those who survive, locking them into a vicious cycle of recurring sickness and faltering growth (UNICEF). Being even mildly underweight increases the risk of death and inhibits cognitive development in children. And it perpetuates the problem across generations, as malnourished women are more likely to have low-birth-weight babies. Stunting, or being below median height for age, is often used as a proxy for multifaceted deprivation and as an indicator of long-term changes in malnutrition.\n\nEstimates are modeled estimates produced by the JME. Primary data sources of the anthropometric measurements are national surveys. These surveys are administered sporadically, resulting in sparse data for many countries. Furthermore, the trend of the indicators over time is usually not a straight line and varies by country. Tracking the current level and progress of indicators helps determine if countries are on track to meet certain thresholds, such as those indicated in the SDGs. Thus the JME developed statistical models and produced the modeled estimates.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Prevalence of stunting, height for age (modeled estimate, % of children under 5)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g., measurement technical error, recording error etc.,). The JME global estimates for overweight take into account estimates of sampling error around survey estimates. While non-sampling error cannot be accounted for or reviewed in full, when available, a data quality review of weight, height and age measurements from household surveys supports compilation of a time series that is comparable across countries and over time.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Prevalence of stunting is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. For children up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the WHO's 2006 Child Growth Standards.\n--------\nOtherweblinks: McLain AC, Frongillo EA, Feng J, Borghi E.
