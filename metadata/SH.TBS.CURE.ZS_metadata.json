Data on the success rate of tuberculosis treatment are provided for countries that have submitted data to the WHO. The treatment success rate for tuberculosis provides a useful indicator of the quality of health services. A low rate suggests that infectious patients may not be receiving adequate treatment. An important complement to the tuberculosis treatment success rate is the case detection rate, which indicates whether there is adequate coverage by the recommended case detection and treatment strategy.\n--------\nTopic: Health: Disease prevention\n",
