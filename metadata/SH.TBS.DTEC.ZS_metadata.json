Estimates for all years are recalculated as new information becomes available and techniques are refined, so they may differ from those published previously.\n--------\nNotesfromoriginalsource: Estimates are presented with uncertainty intervals (see footnote). When ranges are presented, the lower and higher numbers correspond to the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of the outcome distributions (generally produced by simulations). For more detailed information, see the original source.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: World Health Organization, Global Tuberculosis Report.\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Tuberculosis is one of the main causes of adult deaths from a single infectious agent in developing countries. This indicator shows the tuberculosis detection rate for all detection methods. Editions before 2010 included the tuberculosis detection rates by DOTS, the internationally recommended strategy for tuberculosis control. Thus data on the case detection rate from 2010 onward cannot be compared with data in previous editions.\n--------\nTopic: Health: Disease prevention\n",
