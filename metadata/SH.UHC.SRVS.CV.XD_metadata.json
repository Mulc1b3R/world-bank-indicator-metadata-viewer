It is key to improving the well-being of a country\u2019s population. UHC is also an investment in human capital and a foundational driver of inclusive and sustainable economic growth and development. UHC is a target associated with the Sustainable Development Goals (target 3.8), and it relates directly to Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) and to Goal 1 (End poverty in all its forms everywhere).\n--------\nGeneralcomments: This is the Sustainable Development Goal indicator 3.8.1[https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/].\n--------\nIndicatorName: UHC service coverage index\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLongdefinition: Coverage index for essential health services (based on tracer interventions that include reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases and service capacity and access). It is presented on a scale of 0 to 100.\n--------\nNotesfromoriginalsource: For the aggregated data, World Bank\u2019s historical income classification that was based on data from each respective year was used.  For example, the FY2002 income classification based on the 2000 GNI per capita was used for the 2000 aggregates, the FY2007 income classification based on the 2005 GNI per capita was used for the 2005 aggregates, and so on.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nShortdefinition: UHC service coverage index\n--------\nSource: Global Health Observatory. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2023. (https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/service-coverage)\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: The Service Coverage Index used to track SDG 3.8.1 includes four indicator categories, namely (1) reproductive, manternal and newborn and child health, (2) infectious diseases, (3) non-communicable diseases and (4) service capacity and access. Each category contains several tracers. The index is constructed from geometric means of the tracer indicators; first, within each of the four categories, and then across the four category-specific means to obtain the final summary index. See Source for details about methodology.\n--------\nTopic: Health: Universal Health Coverage\n",
