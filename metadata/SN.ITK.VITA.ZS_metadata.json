Vitamin A deficiency, a leading cause of blindness, also causes a greater risk of dying from a range of childhood ailments such as measles, malaria, and diarrhea. In low- and middle-income countries, where vitamin A is consumed largely in fruits and vegetables, daily per capita intake is often insufficient to meet dietary requirements. Providing young children with two high-dose vitamin A capsules a year is a safe, cost-effective, efficient strategy for eliminating vitamin A deficiency and improving child survival. Giving vitamin A to new breastfeeding mothers helps protect their children during the first few months of life. Food fortification with vitamin A is being introduced in many developing countries.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Vitamin A supplementation coverage rate (% of children ages 6-59 months)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLongdefinition: Vitamin A supplementation coverage rate refers to the percentage of children ages 6-59 months old receiving two high-dose vitamin A supplements in a calendar year.\n--------\nNotesfromoriginalsource: Only UNICEF's current vitamin A supplementation priority countries for national level programmes are included.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: UNICEF global databases, based on administrative reports from countries (link: https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/vitamin-a-deficiency/)\n--------\nTopic: Health: Nutrition\n",
