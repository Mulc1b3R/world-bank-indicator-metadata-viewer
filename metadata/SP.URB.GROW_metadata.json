Cities generate jobs and income, and deliver education, health care and other services. Cities also present opportunities for social mobilization and women's empowerment.\n--------\nIndicatorName: Urban population growth (annual %)\n--------\nLicense_Type: CC BY-4.0\n--------\nLicense_URL: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by\n--------\nLimitationsandexceptions: There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for distinguishing urban from rural areas, in part because of the wide variety of situations across countries.\n\nMost countries use an urban classification related to the size or characteristics of settlements. Some define urban areas based on the presence of certain infrastructure and services. And other countries designate urban areas based on administrative arrangements. Because of national differences in the characteristics that distinguish urban from rural areas, the distinction between urban and rural population is not amenable to a single definition that would be applicable to all countries.\n\nEstimates of the world's urban population would change significantly if China, India, and a few other populous nations were to change their definition of urban centers.\n\nBecause the estimates of city and metropolitan area are based on national definitions of what constitutes a city or metropolitan area, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. It is calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: World Bank staff estimates based on the United Nations Population Division's World Urbanization Prospects: 2018 Revision.\n--------\nStatisticalconceptandmethodology: Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. The indicator is calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects. To estimate urban populations, UN ratios of urban to total population were applied to the World Bank's estimates of total population.\n\nCountries differ in the way they classify population as \"urban\" or \"rural.\" The population of a city or metropolitan area depends on the boundaries chosen.\n--------\nTopic: Environment: Density & urbanization\n",
