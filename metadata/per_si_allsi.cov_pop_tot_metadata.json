Moreover, household surveys do not capture the universe of social protection programs in the country, in best practice cases just the largest programs.  As a consequence, ASPIRE indicators are not fully comparable across program categories and countries; however, they provide approximate measures of social protection systems performance.  In addition, there may be cases where ASPIRE performance indicators differ from official WB country reports as ASPIRE indicators are based on a first level analysis of original survey data  and unified methodology that does not necessarily reflect country-specific knowledge and in depth country analysis relying on administrative program level data and/or imputations.\n--------\nLongdefinition: Coverage of social insurance programs shows the percentage of population participating in programs that provide old age contributory pensions (including survivors and disability) and social security and health insurance benefits (including occupational injury benefits, paid sick leave, maternity and other social insurance). Estimates include both direct and indirect beneficiaries.\n--------\nPeriodicity: Annual\n--------\nSource: ASPIRE: The Atlas of Social Protection - Indicators of Resilience and Equity, The World Bank.
